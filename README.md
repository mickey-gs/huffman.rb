# huffman.rb
A simple program that allows for the compression and expansion of strings of text using the Huffman coding algorithm.

## Use
Simply follow the instructions on screen in order to compress or decompress your desired text. Please note that decompressing requires that the program have access to the compressed, binary form of the text, as well as the binary tree from which the compression is completed. These should be titled "sequence.txt and "tree" respectively, and should be placed in the same folder. This folder must then also be in the same folder as the .rb script or .exe application for huffman.rb.

## Versions
### Windows:
Download huffman_master.exe in order to use this program.
### Linux:
Ensure that you have Ruby installed (typing `ruby --version` into the console will let you know if it's installed) and simply run the script by entering `ruby huffman.rb` into console. Note that this requires that the compressor.rb file is downloaded and in the same folder.
